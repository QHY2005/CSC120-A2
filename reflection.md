What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was initially very lost when starting this homework because I did not understand the overall setup and expectations at first. My main difficulty was simply figuring out how to begin, since I was unsure how the different files were supposed to work together. To get started, I looked back at the OneCard example we discussed in class and tried to use it as a reference point. After carefully reading the README and examining the provided main.py, I began to understand the intended structure of the assignment. In particular, I realized that computer.py mainly serves as an “information hub” that stores the data and basic behaviors of a computer, while resale_shop.py is responsible for managing inventory and actions on those computers.

Once I understood this division of responsibility, the task became much clearer, and I noticed that many of the required attributes and behaviors were already implied by how main.py interacted with the objects. This helped guide what needed to be implemented in each class. Based on this experience, I would strongly recommend that future students read the README and main.py carefully before writing any code. Doing so would not only save a significant amount of time, but also make it much easier to understand the logic and relationships between the different components of the program.
